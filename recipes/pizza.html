    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I’ve yet to meet a pizza I didn’t love, but there are a few varieties that just have that extra oomph. Neapolitan pizza is one such pie. It’s simple, perfect, elegant, and rustic at the same time, and I would eat one every single day if I could. Here’s what you need to know about this dish:</p>
    <p>Neapolitan pizza originated in Naples, Italy, hundreds of years ago. Why mess with a good thing? There is even an Italian non-profit organization—the True Neapolitan Pizza Association (Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana), or AVPN—which is dedicated entirely to protecting the integrity and tradition that go into an authentic Neapolitan pizza. </p>
